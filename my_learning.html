            <h2>My Journey Through Education</h2>
        <p>From what I gathered my Daycare to pre-nursery was taken at Maranatha nursery and Primary schools Ngwo, which of course I can't remember due to me being way yoo young back then. I was transferred to New Generation international School in my nursery 1 which is where my memory begins. <br>I grew up as an honour pupil with the achievement of coming overall third in the entire south-east verbal reasoning competition when I was in Primary 3. Time flew by and in the year 2019 I stepped into JSS1 from Primary 4. <br>I got enrolled into a boarding school affiliated with Scripture Union Godly Seeds Christian College to be precise. For me Life in boarding school was scary but I prefered it to being at home for few reasons one being that although the place was with too much people My name wasn't a song being played on repeat unlike when I'm at home where my name just keeps rolling off everyones tongue; calling me to do one thing or the other...well this story is pretty long so I'll end here</p>

                Hmmm... experience <br>
                I can't really say.. <br>
                I'm still growing and learning. <br>
                In terms of academic experience I've not really gotten much of that. <br>I'm about going into colleger the true starting point of education, hopefully I'll shine bright and get scouted early. <br>

        <div class="my_aspiration">
            <p>I've Aspired to be a lot of things while growing up as a child. <br>
            sometimes a Soldier or a president, a doctor or an engineer. <br>
        Back then I didn't even know what the word web developer was. it reached a time in my life when I finally had a an idol or model of sorts, Ben Carson to be specific. <br>Ben Carson was a source of inspiration for me and one of the reasons I wanted to become a Neurosurgeon. I aspired to Be a Neurosurgeon since I was in Primary 1 or there about till SS1 before I finally delved into something due to my own passion and curiosity, as well as my love for technology. <br>I decided I was going to be a software developer and I wasd going to build my own company alongside my friends who are equally going into the same field of study. <br>To be continued.....</p>
