            <h2>My Journey Through Education</h2>
        <p>From what I gathered my Daycare to pre-nursery was taken at Maranatha nursery and Primary schools Ngwo, which of course I can't remember due to me being way yoo young back then. I was transferred to New Generation international School in my nursery 1 which is where my memory begins. <br>I grew up as an honour pupil with the achievement of coming overall third in the entire south-east verbal reasoning competition when I was in Primary 3. Time flew by and in the year 2019 I stepped into JSS1 from Primary 4. <br>I got enrolled into a boarding school affiliated with Scripture Union Godly Seeds Christian College to be precise. For me Life in boarding school was scary but I prefered it to being at home for few reasons one being that although the place was with too much people My name wasn't a song being played on repeat unlike when I'm at home where my name just keeps rolling off everyones tongue; calling me to do one thing or the other...well this story is pretty long so I'll end here</p>
